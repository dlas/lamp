This document specifies the specifics of the hardware/software interface.

Lights:
	We expose a PCA9685 chip on I2C port #2 at address 65.

	Datasheet: [http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/PCA9685.pdf]

	The chip is wired to the LED amplifiers as an open-collector sink;
	pulling a line LOW turns the LED OFF. So, it should be operated in
	open-collector, non-inverting mode.  However, the status LEDs 
	light when a line is pulled LOW; therefore software must invert
	output to the status LEDs.

	The outputs are wired as followed

	LED0	unused
	LED1	Red
	LED2	Green
	LED3	Blue
	LED4..7 unused
	LED8	status led: system good
	LED9	status led: alarm is armed
	LED10	status led: ???
	LED11	status led: fault
	LED12..15 unused

GPIO:
	The circuit exposes a MCP23S08 GPIO chip at I2C port 2, address 38.

	Datasheet: [http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21919e.pdf]

	The GPIO chip connects to three on-board switches and has two external
	pins.  The switches short to ground when pressed; they should be
	configured as inputs with the pullup resistor enabled.  They will
	read as "1" normally and "0" when depressed. 

	The two external IO pins may be used as input or output in any configuration.

	GPIO0	SW3 	Preset
	GPIO1	SW2	Intensity
	GPIO2	SW1	Arm/disarm alarm
	GPIO3	J4/pin3
	GPIO4	J4/pin2
	GPIO5..7 unused

AUDIO:
	The circuit exposes a CS4270 audio codec on the I2S lines of the BBB.
	
	Datasheet: [https://www.cirrus.com/en/pubs/proDatasheet/CS4270_F1.pdf]

	The I2C/SPI configuration mechanism is unused and the chip is
	pin-strapped into a static configuration. The chip is configured to
	operate in single-speed (4-54KHZ) with a MCLK to LRCK ratio of 512.
	The beaglebone fixes the master clock to 24576000 so the chip will only
	play audio at 48KHZ.

	ALSA does not correctly detect this situation so you must manually specify
	a bit rate. For example: 
		mplayer -srate 48000 music.mp3
