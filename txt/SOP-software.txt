Base software source is: bone-debian-8.6-lxqt-4gb-armhf-2016-11-06-4gb.img
Extract this software and 'dd' onto a SDIO card.  Device use DHCP at
startup to get network access via ethernet. use DHCP logs to find IP 
address. ssh into dev as user root.

Modifications:
Add the line
	cmdline=coherent_pool=1M quiet cape_universal=enable video=HDMI-A-1:1280x720@60e
to /etc/uEnv.txt (replacing the old cmdline). This fixes audio issues

Note, the base OS omits support for analog in (unused in this code).
