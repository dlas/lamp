Base software source is: bone-debian-8.6-lxqt-4gb-armhf-2016-11-06-4gb.img
Extract this software and 'dd' onto a SDIO card.  Device use DHCP at
startup to get network access via ethernet. use DHCP logs to find IP 
address. ssh into dev as user root.

Modifications:
1) Add the line
	cmdline=coherent_pool=1M quiet cape_universal=enable video=HDMI-A-1:1280x720@60e
to /etc/uEnv.txt (replacing the old cmdline). This fixes audio issues

2) Download and install GO from
https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.7.4.linux-armv6l.tar.gz

3) use "go get webmain" to build

4) run "install.sh" to install. It will install to /root/alarmclock

5) Sign up for a google API at
https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=calendar
download the "client secret" information and put it in a file:
/root/alarmclock/client_secret.json

6) Set up wireless; the debian documentation is about as shit as expected.
	use conmanctl:
		conmanctl> tether wifi disable
		conmanctl> enable wifi
		conmanctl> scan wifi
		conmanctl> connect <<<THING YOU WANNA CONNECT TO >>>
	to figure out connection parameters. THen make a file
	/var/lib/connman/rivendel-psk.config that looks like this:

[service_wifi_08bd438a8622_726976656e64656c6c_managed_psk]
Type = wifi
Name = rivendel
Passphrase = VERYSECRET!

		



Note, the base OS omits support for analog in (unused in this code).
